We depend on the following gstreamer source modules:
gstreamer
gst-plugins-base
gst-plugins-good

And in more detail, on the following plugins (this information may be useful if your distribution package the gstreamer plugins in a different way):
tee
queue
gamma
v4l2src
alsasrc
filesink
fakesink
theoraenc
vorbisenc
xvimagesink
matroskamux
videobalance
ffmpegcolorspace

Also, to get Facebook support we depend of kipi-facebook (normally packaged just within kipi-plugins).
